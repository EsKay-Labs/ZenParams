# ⚡ ZenParams PRO ⚡

### _THE "GOD MODE" PARAMETER MANAGER FOR FUSION 360_

> 🛑 **WARNING:** This plugin may cause sudden bursts of extreme productivity, uncontrollable smiling during the design phase, and a complete intolerance for manual data entry.

## 😤 THE PROBLEM

Let's be real. Managing parameters in Fusion 360 is **boring**.
You start a new design. You type `tol_snug = 0.15mm`. You type `wall_thick = 1.2mm`. You do this **EVERY. SINGLE. TIME.**
You are a creative engineer, not a data entry clerk. Stop acting like one.

## 🚀 THE SOLUTION

**ZenParams PRO** is the high-octane injection your workflow has been screaming for. It takes the tedious, soul-crushing task of parameter management and automates it into a **single click**.

We didn't just build a plugin. We built a **Time Machine** that gives you back hours of your life.

## 🔥 KILLER FEATURES

- Switching to CNC Aluminum? **CLICK.** Boom, your machining allowances are set.

### 2. ↕️ FLEXIBLE UI (NEW)

- **Resizable Columns**: Hover between column headers to drag and resize them to your liking.
